# snakeGame non-authoral, source code from Bro Code, snake game in JS : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0B3nHhKmM

### At this point i was starting in the web development universe, i was excited and full of dreams, i found this amazing work from Bro Code and jump into coding.
#### But yes, at my very first second i just realized i didnt know any of this yet, but kept copying and trying to understand whatever i could! Hoping one day i could jump back and make it one by myself!
##### This is for my future me, i hope you did it, cause right now i tried to check it again after some classes, free code camp exercises and youtube videos, and still, but better than before.
